Core Features
This project was built to not only meet but exceed the competition's requirements, focusing on a premium, interactive feel.

Gameplay & Logic
Dynamic Ticket Generation: Generates valid 9x3 Tambola tickets with the correct number distribution (5 numbers per row, following column rules 1-10, 11-20, etc.).

Random Number Picker: Draws unique numbers from 1 to 90 without repetition, ensuring a fair game every time.

Interactive Number Board: A clear and intuitive 1-90 grid that visually tracks all numbers that have been called, making it easy to check your tickets.

UI & UX
Modern & Polished Design: A clean, card-based layout inspired by modern web aesthetics, using a professional color palette and typography for excellent readability.

Fluid Animations: The interface is packed with subtle but satisfying animations to enhance the user experience:

3D Ticket Hover: Tickets lift and tilt with a smooth 3D transform on mouseover.

Auto-Daubing Animation: When a drawn number is present on your ticket, it's automatically marked with a delightful and smooth golden highlight animation.

Button Micro-interactions: Buttons provide tactile feedback on hover and click.

Text-to-Speech Number Announcer: To make the game more immersive and accessible, the application uses the browser's Web Speech API to announce each drawn number out loud.

Fully Responsive: The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, providing a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
